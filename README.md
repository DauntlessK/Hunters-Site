An online version of the Hunters: U-boat solitaire board game. Recreated from my console version originally programmed in Python.

Featuring full GUI and a tactical view with animated sprites.

Long-term post-1.0 goals:
-Weather animation (randomized) for encounters
-Submarine sprites matching each sub-type
-Damage on sub sprites
-Damage on ship sprites
-Animations for: sinking, depth charges, torpedo launches, diving deep, returning to port
-Airplanes
